Project Two: Animal Shelter
This application allows a user access to a database of animals in an animal shelter called the Austin Animal Center (AAC) to search and edit the database. The user would search using various filters to find exactly what they’re looking for. Grazioso Salvare, the person who requested this project, wants us to create a dashboard. This will allow users to easily search the database. This project allows a user to explore the application using geolocation mapping and charts/graphs to locate and utilize animals for search and rescue.

Motivation
The project was created to test my knowledge working with databases on MongoDB and manipulating the information in it. It is also testing my ability to work with Jupyter Notebook and to create a dashboard for people to use with ease. Python was chosen as the language because it is used primarily in MongoDB. Python can be compiled very quickly, utilizing a built-in compiler via Jupyter Notebook.

Getting Started
1. Open MongoDB and import the csv file aac_shelter_outcome.csv. 
2. Create a simple and complex index to parse the data.
3. To authenticate a user, you want to create both an Admin account and an aacuser account to access the database.
4. The user needs to have access to a python IDE and run the program on Jupyter notebook. 
5. Enter the address and connect.

Installation
A current version of Python on any IDE and access to Jupyter Notebook to run both the .py and the. ipynb files. Access to PyMongo, Dash, Pandas, Plotly, and Leaflet libraries to create functions in the dash.

MongoDB 
Access the database to search or alter its data. All of the information related to the animal shelter is within MongoDB. This information needs to be imported into the project to create the dashboard Grazioso Salvare requested.

Usage

Code Example

This imports my CRUD module from project one into project two with my updated username and password.
 











This is to add Grazioso Salvare’s logo to the dashboard. I have also included a unique identifier.
 

Gives a functioning radio button, drop down menu, and checkboxe.
 

This is to create the interactive data table and make it user-friendly. This is from module six.
 












This is to filter the data table using MongoDB queries.
 


Errors:
I have encountered a few errors working with this project and leading up to it. For some reason I cannot correctly connect my CRUD module with my Jupyter Notebook project. I tried using PyCharm and Thonny as well with no luck. This is why my screenshots are in PyCharm and not Jupyter this time. I’m sure I made some errors within my code but the error messages I get are not helping me understand the issue. I cannot get the dashboard to load because of the inability to import the data from MongoDB. I hope that the code I provided will get me partial credit because it has been a struggle. I think I understand how to do this type of work, I am just unsure of how to connect everything together and get a functioning dashboard. I am comfortable working within MongoDB and creating/editing databases, I just cannot seem to import that information into my project effectively.
